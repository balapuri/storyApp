With Facebook login, we could have a database of users. To add contributors to the story, maybe we could go through the database and see which users are friends, or maybe we could go through the users friend list to see which are also present in our database. Then we could present those friends in a table view to be selected.

Maybe Parse login would be easier though. With Parse login, we won't have any 'friends'. A user will be able to add any other user as a contributor.
